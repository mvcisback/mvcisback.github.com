title: NixOs and moving to Formal Methods
---

I figured I'd write a post about my pending switch from Arch Linux to NixOS. While Arch has been a _fantastic_ distro, the transition from Arch to Nix represents my new found appreciation for [formal methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).

Other examples include my continued transition from Python[^1]/C to Haskell. While I can't imagine myself completely abandoning either, being able to have the compiler verify alot of the correctness of the code is a big plus. In the same vein, Nixos appearts to offer a solid theoretical basis for managing configurations and packages.

I'll probably write a longer (more indepth) post about my thoughts after using it for awhile. 

 [^1]: Although the [mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) project may satisfy alot of my secret desires for python
