<title>Hello Strapdown</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">
  Hi internet...So I've decided to retry this whole blogging thing...
I've been getting into more and more projects recently, and have been making sure to take pictures so I think this time I'll have alot more content.

While I'm not exactly sure what all is gonna be blogged ([blagged?](http://xkcd.com/239))

For now here's a picture of a practice pad I thats shoved with piezo's.
