# About Project #

This blog post is about my submission for the [teapot rendering contest](http://graphics.cs.illinois.edu/cs418/sp14/mp3) for CS418@UIUC.
The goal was to render a realistic teapot using various effects. Being a formal methods and functional programming junkie,
I searched for a purely functional way to do this in Haskell. What I found was GPIPE.

# About GPIPE #

Based on the [Wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GPipe):

- GPipe is an alternative to OpenGl, and has the advantage that it is:
    1. purely functional
    2. statically typed
    3. operates on immutable data
    4. Shaders are written as regular Haskell functions using GPU data types

## Limitations ##
The 2 biggest limitations of GPIPE's are lack of support and missing convenience functions.
Specifically, all the transformations, lighting, texturing must be done as shaders. While initially a bit of a hinderance, it ultimately allowed me to move far beyond the capabilities of the fixed pipeline (and with greater understanding).

# Effects #
## Lighting Models ##
I ended up implementing both the Phong and Seeliger (seen in the skin textured teapot) lighting models.

## Texturing ##
## Reflection Maps ##
# Obj Parsing #
## Testing Cylindrical and Spherical Texturing ##
## Initial plans for OBJ transformations ##
