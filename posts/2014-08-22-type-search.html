<h2>Type_Search</h2>
<h2 id="type-search">Type Search</h2>
<p>My favorite feature in the pipeline is Type Search. DxR already had this in the form of searching for various classes and type definitions, but this extends that to function type signatures. Haskell’s Hoogle heavily influenced the design of DxR’s Type Search, so if you’re familar with that tool you’ll feel right at home.</p>
<p>If not, you might be thinking “Ok… wooo /s”. The strength of this technique is certainly less powerful without the more expressive type systems found in ML style languages, but I contend that type chasing is still often the best way to explore an API.</p>
<h3 id="c-type-search">C Type Search</h3>
<p>To get a taste for what I mean, lets go over an example with C.</p>
<p>This is an example query. We’re still playing with the Query DSL so input is appreciated. The syntax is similar to C++11’s auto function syntax.</p>
<p>If Q here were a Queue Data Structure, you can imagine what kind of functions this might bring. C allows for implicit arguments and doesn’t explicitly give interfaces so its impossible to say things for sure, but the semantics of the functions returns can’t really depend on T. They could be funcitons like first, last, or some arbitrarily fixed element index into the list (with a default of course).</p>
<p>An underscore or auto indicates that you’re only interested in the shape. It’s reminiscent of type variables, but without the ability to uniquely identify between them. Type variables are something that I’d like to eventually see, and mostly involves just touch the Elastic Search analyzer code. So if a type signature matches exactly, it should obviously be at the top of the search results. But what about fuzzy matching? For this we turn to edit distances. At this point I need a disclaimer: this feature is not finished, but if you like the idea stay stuned.</p>
<p>Suppose we decide to specialize _ for int. 1 edit distance. What about adding a pointer container around it. 1 edit distance. What about adding an extra argument? 1 edit distance. And there’s really no reason to limit the edits to the inputs. <em>Quickly go over more examples</em> I think you get the point.</p>
