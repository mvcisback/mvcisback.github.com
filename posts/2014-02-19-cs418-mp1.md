title: Dancing I
---

This is the result of the first MP for my graphics class. I've gone ahead and dumped the readme I quickly wrote up it, as well as include some frames from the video. This project is my first non-trivial Haskell project, implemented from scratch. [Source Code](https://github.com/mvcisback/cs418-mp1 ) 

## Libraries ##
There were a few libraries like lambdacube3d and gpipe that offered the prospect of functional and put graphics development, however both seemed like they'd take to much take to get started. Another libary, [diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) offers a really nice DSL for generating shapes, but its focus is not performance.

## Disclaimer ##
Before moving on, I'd like to quote the MP1 spec "The notes demonstrate a couple of models of the block letter 'I' and you can code up one of these, or create your own model, possibly with more detail or a different font style."

## 12 Vertex Calls :p ##
- I decided to use a different model for the I than the one given in class. Given that (as far as I can tell) the 15 vertices call solution requires 13 vertex, this is more or less necessary
- The 15 vertex call solution is ugly (code wise), and I wanted to see if I could get it down to 1 triangle strip.
- By exploiting the font style loophole, I moved the points intersecting with the base down slightly.
- This enabled the model to be 100% stripable...i.e. it just needed 12 vertex calls
- The variable epsilon in the code can be tuned so that it looks arbitrarily close to the original

## Not a T intersection ##
- I'd like to stress that what _looks_ like a T intersection...is actually 2 very thin triangles.
- In the majority of animations, I left epsilon such that this can be seen.
- In output_I.mkv, I made epsilon such that it looks like a T intersection

# Animation #
- The functions wiggle and render act as a CPU based vertex shader
- The animation is set to move with the system clock, and will add/drop frames so that it has the same movement regardless of the FPS (which is set by GLUT + VSYNC + X)

# Video #
videos produced by: ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 25 -i :0.0 output.mkv
there seems to be a warm up period (the video caputures at a lower framerate and then it stablizes)

## Video Files ##
 1. [output_0.mkv](http://youtu.be/DN7oKrY5NUg) : Animation freq set to 0x

 2. [output_1.mkv](http://youtu.be/tp0IpmAu1rA)  : Animation freq set to 1x

 3. [output_2.mkv](http://youtu.be/hE5y2vH3fXo)  : Animation freq set to 2x
