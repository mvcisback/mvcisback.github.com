<title>Hello Strapdown</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">

I figured I'd write a post about my pending switch from Arch Linux to NixOS. While Arch has been a _fantastic_ distro, the transition from Arch to Nix in some sense represents my new found appreciation (addiction) for [formal methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).

Other examples include my continued transition from Python[^1]/C to Haskell. While I can't imagine myself completely abandoning Python (or C), being able to rely on the infrastructure for proving certain semantic features in the code is a huge plus (no side effects and real type consistency, not that lame stuff in most mainstream languages). In the same vein, NixOS appears to offer a solid theoretical basis for managing configurations and packages. In theory it also allows faster deployment, reproducible setups, and _version control_ at almost every relevant part of system configuration. There are other tools to do this (salt, puppet, etc), but they tend to operate on what I've found to be a more stateful approach.

I'll probably write a longer (more indepth) post about my thoughts after using it for awhile....
