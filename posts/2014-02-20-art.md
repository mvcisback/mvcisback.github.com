title: Art & Diagrams

For my intro to art class we need to bring in a 5"x7" image with a grid overlayed onto it.
I certainly didn't want it by hand so I turned to the Haskell Diagrams DSL.

This took me ~10 minutes to get working. I first went with a vbar approach, but didn't like the way it ended up. While I could have spent time fiddling with the line params, I decided to try to actually build the grid out of squares :p. Here's the result:

``` haskell
{-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}

import Diagrams.Prelude
import Diagrams.Backend.Cairo.CmdLine
import Diagrams.TwoD.Image

world :: FilePath -> Diagram B R2
world path = grid <> picture
    where squares = (hcat $ replicate 6 (square 1)) # scaleX (5/6) # scaleY (7/8)
          grid = (vcat $ replicate 8 squares) # centerXY
          picture = image path 5 7 # centerXY

main = mainWith $ world
```

The usage is:
```
$ ./grid_gen pika.png -w 500 -h 700 -o pika_grid.png
```

generating something like

![](/images/pika_grid.png) [^1]

Over all it actually spent me more time figuring out how to get zenburn syntax highlighting in this post, than writing this haskell program. Way to go diagrams :p
