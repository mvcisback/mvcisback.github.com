<title>Hello Strapdown</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">
  Hey, so if you've been wondering why I've been so inactive (aside from school) I do a good deal of the updating of the website over at: [http://acm-uiuc.github.io/sigdave/](http://acm-uiuc.github.io/sigdave/)

Also, I'm finishing up the process of accepting my internship with Mozilla this summer (yay!)
They have me working on [dxr](https://github.com/mozilla/dxr). I'll be sure to keep this site updated with those endeavors.

Lastly, I've started using twitter (well I have yet to post anything...but I'm using it none the less!!!)
In the future I plan to have a hashtag associated with every post so that its easy to have discussions about them.
